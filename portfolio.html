      <h2>HalalBytes</h2>
      <p>HalalBytes is a project I worked on during my first hackathon, where we won Best Beginner Hack! My team and I tackled challenges with API calls, Firebase Real-Time Database, and trying to integrate the two smoothly. Despite initial struggles, we pushed through with persistence and teamwork, ultimately reaching the prototyping stage. It was my first time using Figma, which proved to be an invaluable tool for visualizing our ideas and iterating on designs. The experience was both challenging and rewarding, giving me a deeper appreciation for both development and design.</p>
